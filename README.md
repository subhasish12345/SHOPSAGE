## Key User Workflows

### 1. End-to-End Order Flow
1.  **Browse & Cart:** User browses products and adds them to their cart.
2.  **Place Order:** A draft order is created with `paymentStatus: "PENDING"`. A Cloud Function validates stock and computes the final price.
3.  **Payment:** The user pays via Razorpay. A webhook confirms the payment.
4.  **Confirmation:** On successful payment, the order status becomes `CONFIRMED`, and a shipment record is created.
5.  **Seller Fulfillment:** The seller packs the order and marks it `READY_FOR_DISPATCH`.
6.  **Logistics:** The order is assigned to a delivery agent.
7.  **Delivery:** The agent updates the status in real-time and uploads proof of delivery.
8.  **Completion:** The order is marked `DELIVERED`, and payout/commission processes are triggered.

### 2. Refund & Payout Flow
- **Refunds:** The support team flags an order for a refund. The finance team reviews and approves it, triggering a refund via the payment gateway API.
- **Payouts:** A scheduled job calculates seller settlements. The finance team processes the payouts and notifies sellers.
